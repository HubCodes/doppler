## Story (tl;dr)

I bought a new keyboard, which was a Bluetooth-enabled model.
I was impressed by the fact that I can code with the keyboard while on
the go via an ssh connection on the iPad. How wonderful is this!

But the fatal problem I faced was that the screen was too small to have
both a browser and a terminal running at the same time.
So I used command-tab keys to go back and forth between the two,
but doing so was a bad experience.
Because the terminal has been relaunched frequently.

I thought this problem would be solved if I could find the information
I wanted in the terminal. So I looked for a web browser that works in 
terminal but it wasn't cool.
